Name: Arina
What have you done since yesterday?
  - implemented 3 recycle views and an adapter to display the time line
  - worked on creating dividers to make the table look more like a table than a list
  - with the help of my teammates, I was able to add courses to each column (array list/ recycler views) respective to when the courses were offered

What are you planning on doing today?
- debug code and look for edge cases

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
- the list of courses were not showing up, I realized the issue was with the padding and alignment of the textview and with the help of my teammate Mohammad I was able to fix the issue
