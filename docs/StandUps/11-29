Name: Mohammed
What have you done since yesterday?
	- Agreed with Arina on what our smaller tasks are going to be in which, generally speaking,  I would be responsible of taking in the user input of the courses(considering all edge cases i can think about) and pass it to the next fragment where Arina would have to look into the session offered and display those courses.

What are you planning on doing today?
	-Design a general UI and code for my sake to note down all ideas and the approaches I want to use in order to perform my part of the code
